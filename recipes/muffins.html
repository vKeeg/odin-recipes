                    <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
                    <li>3 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1/4 tablespoon almond extract</li>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 tablespoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                    <li>1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups finely chopped rhubarb</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="muffinsteps">Steps</h3> 
                <ul class="muffinlist">
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line two muffin pans with liners.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn the mixer speed up to medium-high, and beat batter until it is very light and fluffy, and has lightened in color, about 5 minutes. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts.</li>
                    <li>Add in 1 cup flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg and mix on low speed until just combined. Add in yogurt and mix until just combined. Add in remaining 1 cup flour and mix until just incorporated. Fold in chopped rhubarb.</li>
                    <li>Divide batter between the lined muffin cups, filling each one about 3/4 full.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until muffins spring back lightly when touched, 20 to 23 minutes. Allow muffins to cool in the pan a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                </ul>
